# Information
This repository provides a setup script `setup.sh` which installs the AI Voice development manager.
The development manager can then be used to install and manage AI Voice projects.

# Note
Most of the AI Voice repositories are not yet public, so running the setup script will fail unless you are listed as a collaborator.
